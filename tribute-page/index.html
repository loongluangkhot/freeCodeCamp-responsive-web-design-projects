      <h2>Some facts about Alan Kay:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1970, Kay joined the Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, California.</li>
        <li>Using the programming language <em>Smalltalk</em>, Kay developed prototypes of networked workstations.</li>
        <li>Along with his colleagues, Kay conceptualized the idea of <em>object-oriented programming (OOP)</em>, a paradigm that has impacted the field in a very fundamental way.</li>
        <li>Terms coined by Kay and his colleagues include "object" and "class".</li>
        <li>According to Kay, the central idea of OOP is about "messaging", rather than "object".</li>
        <li>Kay was a molecular biology major in college, and his understanding and passion in cellular mechanisms somewhat inspire the birth of OOP.</li>
        <blockquote>I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning â€“ it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful).</blockquote>
